|| ISSUE | HOW TO FIND | TIME TO FIND | HOW TO FIX | TIME TO FIX
--- | --- | --- | --- |---| ---  
1 | Going to $SERVER_IP, getting redirect to http://mntlab | 1) Check server config files: <br> `cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` |5m| Remove *redirect* directive with entire *VirtualHost* block, we have it in *vhost.conf*| 20m 
2 | Requests are going to httpd only, not forwarding to tomcat server | 1) Check mod_jk log <br> `cat /var/log/httpd/modjk.log` <br> 2) Check virtual host and workers config files:  <br> `cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf` <br> Log file says that Tomcat is not started or listening on wrong port. And worker name is wrong. <br> `cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/workers.properties` | 5m |  Edit *VirtualHost* directive in *vhost.conf*, change address to * , to enable bind on all interfaces <br> Fix wrong worker name and ip/port in *workers.properties*   | 50m
3 | Recieving error page | 1) Checking site with `curl` and getting 503 error. Tomcat unavailible. <br> 2) Check Tomcat is running <br> `netstat -tulpan` <br> there are no java services that listening to 8005,8080 ports | 20m | Start Tomcat server <br> `service tomcat start` | 1m
4 | Still recieving error page | Check Tomcat is running and listening ports <br> `service tomcat status` <br> Output: tomcat is running <br> `netstat -tulpan` <br> Not listening. <br> Check Tomcat init script. <br> Someone forwarded output to /dev/null and added *success* result to all cases. So if script won't start output always will be *success* | 80m | Fix init script by removing *> /dev/null* and *success* | 60m
